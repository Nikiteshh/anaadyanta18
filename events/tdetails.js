Design Constraints <br>\
1. The RC plane should measure a maximum of 1.0 m along any direction<br>\
2. T/W =0.75 (if excess thrust is found, it will be neutralized by adding weight below the plane at centre of gravity) <br>\

5. Use of gyroscopes (gyros) is prohibited 6. One of the team members should fly the aircraft and another should call the stunts as they are performed (just before).<br>\
Format of the Competition<br>\
 The competition requires the participants to design a RC plane (no Readymade Planes are allowed) and perform a set of manoeuvres’. The event will be conducted at the grounds of the scheduled arena and participants will need to bring their aircraft and all necessary equipment to this venue.The arena will be an open ground. <br>\
There will be two rounds of the competition.<br>\
A. Qualifier Round <br>\
B. Manoeuvre Round<br>\
Qualifier Round<br>\
The best measure of the design of an aircraft can be done by climb and gliding time. To examine this, participants have to climb for 20 seconds. After this, they need to perform a dead stick flight (throttle=0 or Gliding). The plane however can be manoeuvred while it’s gliding. The teams will be graded based on a) Smooth Climb (35%) b) Glide Time (65%) Top 30% teams from the qualifier round will qualify to Manoeuvre Round.<br>\
Manoeuvre Round<br>\
Teams will have to perform the following manoeuvres’ mandatorily at least once (not necessarily in the given order), the participants get the scoring as below:<br>\
Manoeuvre<br>\
Score<br>\
Roll  ( both aileron and barrel)<br>\
10<br>\
Loop <br>\
10<br>\
Cuban eight <br>\
10<br>\
Vertical Charlie<br>\
10<br>\
Flat spin<br>\
10<br>\
After having completed all the mandatory maneuvers’, the teams can perform the above maneuvers’ repeatedly in any extra time they have remaining before landing for extra points. A maximum time of 4 minutes will be given to take off, complete the maneuver-set and land. Taking as many laps are allowed within 4 minutes but, the option has to be called before performance. Any further instructions would be given before the competition, on the spot. As soon as the timer crosses given time, only the points gathered by the aircraft till that moment are considered.<br>\
Rules <br>\
1. Each team would be given 2 chances for each of the rounds and the best score is considered as per the scoring procedure mentioned above for each round <br>\
2. The timer will start from the moment the aircraft is in the air for both the rounds.<br>\

Round 2(Designing the structure): the teams will be given a maximum of 1 hour to design their structure based on the materials provided in the auctioning. <br>\
Round 3(Testing): The model built by each team will be tested by dropping it from a height of 40 ft. The teams will be given a second chance to modify their structure (within 10 minutes), in case the first one doesn’t work out for them.<br>\

The model will be evaluated based on its effectiveness, simplicity, design explanation, aesthetics and time to design the model. There will be some penalty in case the model doesn’t work in the first attempt. <br>\
Grading Policy (out of 100 points) <br>\
The model will be graded only if the egg remains intact or is just partially cracked (content of the egg doesn’t come out).<br>\
